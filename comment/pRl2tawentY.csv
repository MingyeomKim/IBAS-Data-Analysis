Namjoon being straight forward and won't tolerated someone messing up with Armies. That's our leader.
Y'all papa mochi is back😁😁

"Dts are not tolerated in this fandom period. Who ever did that is not part of the Army. But general public don’t know that a lot of haters are cosplaying as Army trying to make us look bad, in fact GP don’t even now the amount of effort and energy this haters waste on BTS and the things they did and still do 😪 only Army and BTS we know our daily struggles.. . Anyways, my boys are with us that’s all I care about and that was lit Joonie 😊 thank you 💜"
I can't put into words how much I love these 7 guys! Namjoon bringing up the joke incident and always standing up for armys! I just know I pciked the righ people to support bc they always ALWAYS respect us and give back so much love! And I really admire his diplomatic skills how he reassured James when he saw how he got nervous but sincerely spoke about armys' good side! . . And I just really love how comfortable and happy they are! Teasing each other! Ahhh this interview made me soo emotional!
Gotta get someone who stans ARMY'S like BTS💜💜💜💜💜. Got BTS behind us when we say so💜🕺💜🕺💜🕺💜
Love you Jimin ahhhhhhh ❤️
If Namjoon says we forgive you I’ll think about it.
Bullshit 💩💩💩. Sorry i would have given a purple shit I couldn't find one
Why didnt they apologise to James on behalf of the toxic armies that sent him death threats?
and this is why Jimmy Kimmel is better than james corden
What Suga wants Suga gets they are going to be nominated until they win a Grammy and if Suga says he wants more Grammys he will get more Grammys
💜💜💜
Bro whoever said “hope you die” took it too far
"I think it's Kinda stupid, that Namjoon have him the opportunity to apology, and instwad of acually apologizing he just talked about how much he loves them blabla bla"
🐍🐍: we love you
this is so wholesome
I don't know why ppl are twisting his words..James was trying to be a victim when himself was misogynistic and disrespectful and RM clearly deflected the topic and focused on apology cuz he wanted to clear the air simply as there won't be any bad blood between them. The only ppl who are making a fuss and twisting things way more are just jobless weirdos on stan twt..get a job seriously!!!! They are literally the most humble and positive people I've ever seen who really just stay in their own world and don't have issues and beef with anyone..Just let them be..
POV you came hear from the girl who post this on tiktok
I'm sorry but it feels like james you're faking it again
Yeah.. We accept the apology papa mochi😌💜 . . ARMY💜BTS for eternal
armys are so annoying being embarassing for what
I noticed they had their in-ears in during the interview. I wonder if the translator was talking to them through those. I know it’s possible.
يعمري لطيفين 😭 😭 احس وحيده عربيه في تعليقات
Mochi meet papa mochii 💜
I'm happy this got cleared out. . . . . I didn't like James to be disliked. . . . . Life's too short to hold grudges
Hi
"Everyone is talking about rm and jimin, meanwhile me just enjoying jin's sarcasm 😅😅😅"
V looks like he just woke up From a nap LMAO
Wait…why was James carrying jimin across a street? 🤣
한글 자막이 필요하다
"When namjoon said we appreciate your apology , james almost said that it wasn't"
"Honestly, LOL armies are so god complex pls"

نامجون يقصف ولا يبالي
Ain't got nothin on Mrbeast's Squid Game Vid!
As a Army from Indiana USA I accepted James Corden ( aka: our papi mochi)
Yes yes james sankeu
Sorry papa mochi😅 we were wrong
https://youtu.be/LwrdCEiAKWY
not Rm speaking with a British accent when he is around James
あぁ．．幸せ❤️
"Now, James can relate what BTS had gone through being hated back then. The members were at some point singled out and hated by other fandoms. I’m sure they understand how James must have felt. You can see them pay attention and nod listening to James’ explanation. They are indeed a good example"
At first I was disappointed but for now I love you thank you papa mochi
Love you dear❤️❤️❤️🌎🌎🤩🤩🤩
You have been in hot water with army's are you alright??. 💀Best one 💀🖤
im not hating but i think he got scared of armys power and apology
My boyss😘😘😘🤩😘🤩🤩🤩😘🤩😘🤩😘🤩
Jiminshiiii❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
OMG park Jimin love u
지민이랑 파파모찌 너무 귀여워~~♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Just subscribing again coz he just apologized .
"Army should apologize to james they are most toxic fandom we can see in our whole life :).  They say Every thing is ok ? Haaaa?. They send him death threats , sham on u"
awh jimin cho cute
They r my happy pill😙💝
"Going crazy for our  legend's, pot your hands up ""Pak Army""😍😍🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩,we all love you BTS ,and purple you, soooooooo much love from Pakistan guys 🤩🤩💜💜💜💜💜💞💞💞💗💗💗💓💖💖💖💌💌💝💝💝"
It's my second time to watch this I watch that a few minutes ago since it was released 😅 I'm addicted on how namjoon start to speak up about James Corden
Amazing ❤❤😍
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜BTS
We got the apology at least!
"This is probably one of the most brutally honest interviews I have ever watched. Started off with talking about what went down in the fandom is something huge in itself coz what happens among the fans is not something that has ever affected anyone before THIS drastically. Welp, we are talking about army now- . But when James mentioned THIS 2:35…. It kinda exceeded the limits. My heart literally dropped and I had to pause the video to soak in his words…. That’s… too much."
Two of my favorite entertainers...BTS & James Corden. Love the late late show.
🐍
I absolutely love papa mochis and bts' relationship it's so wholesome 👏🏻 but he didn't ask hobie any question:(
Their unity is so strong 💪
James rn:🤡
"저거 어케 다 알아 듣냐,,,"
"Not this weak ass apology where he makes himself the victim, bue"
We'd love to see the things under the clothes jimin.....
Its awesome
V wanting to say something and raising his hand is just so adorable 🥰❤️
Hypocrite james
A lot of love from Pakistan 🇵🇰♥😍
"You did a great mistake but still they forgive you,,, They are so kind and you are so lucky that they forgive you so easily,,, Whatever I don’t wanna bring the past back,, We all forgave you but remember trust is like a broken glass when It's broken it can't be enforced anymore☺️"
Is this better for you? Tae didn't even shake hands with you 😒💢 You have more than one face 🤡
I love this show
Not James about to say 'it wasn't an apology' like no you didn't even say sorry hun x
The tea is ready James ☕💅🏻
Be sure to watch my short video🤣
I liked that how they clarified all the misconceptions through an interview
ارمي حطو ترجمة تلقائية وحطو العربية وتابعوا انا تابعت
Those who lynched this man are now watching with laughter.
Imagine Jimin giving you hug 😩
Lol man got roasted
They are sooo forgiving 🤍🤍🤍
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"James looked so flustered when rm brought it up like he didn't expect it at all, and then he nervously rambles about how it was ""harmless jokes"" and how he's army too and loves bts Alot but brings up the DM he got about wishing he dies idk why the hell he'd say that, but not in one second he says anything like I'm sorry I should've used my words better and it makes sense that the fans misunderstood my intentions when I wasn't really offensing you guys or ur fans bla bla bla, good that RM cuts him off and says we accept your APOLOGY 😂😂 a Savage legend I swear.. I feel like if the media and these TV hosts weren't afraid of the Fandom they would've taken bts's kindness for granted cuz they expect them to never clap back or say anything. Good to see that rm showed them today that they do have army right behind them but they will speak for themselves too if they wanted."
