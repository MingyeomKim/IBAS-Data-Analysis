"So jin is getting a lot of hate on Twitter because a jk fanbase took a ss of people calling jin main vocalist. Why will you hate on jin if people think he has the capability of being a main vocalist? And calling jin main vocalist isn't disrespecting jk, this people are just praising jin without mentioning jk, so please don't attack or hate jin. And please leave good comments about jin and jk"
Da-na-na-na-na-na❤💃
❤😭
JK is indeed a musically inclined person…Jungkook vocals is so addicting😍…the adlibs are always on point and sometimes he change it to add more flavor..he realky has good ears…the consistency of his voice 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 ..his voice is really versatile  you can  put him on any genre and still slay…this man can really sing  while dancing but keeping his voice so stable and sounded effortless even with a difficult choreography..i can feel that drive in him..his craving to learn more ..i can’t imagine what can Jungkook do more..cause honestly i can feel that he was just about to start..and when he start..i bet there’s no stopping.. .he is not on his limit yet…he has more to offer…way to go JK!!! 🐰🐰🐰 keep that fire and drive in you..Lets get it get it !
너희의 용기와 진심을 응원하고 사랑해
